Hello World!
My name is Taylor Bosch and I'm interested in learning more about data science using Python, R, and SQL. I'm about to earn my PhD in Basic Biomedical Sciences at the University of South Dakota. Throughout my doctoral studies, I've learned a lot about myself, the most important of which is that I love coding and solving complex problems. As such, I am looking to start a career as a data scientist after I graduate! At the moment, my coding experience has been primarily in LabVIEW for creating stimulus presentation software for my experiments, MATLAB for creating and running scripts that streamline fMRI and EEG data preprocessing, and R to run my analyses. I'm a quick learner and am eager to dive into data science head first (once I finish my dissertation that is). If anyone has any advice, training code, or is looking for an entry-level data scientist with excellent communication, critical thinking, and problem solving skills, look no further!
